What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?

  Q stands for quality. the learning part comes from the fact that the code looks to find the best possible path to an objective that gets the most possible points. 

What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
  
  RL is a process where a computer keeps trying different things, and it is rewaerded for desirable outcomes and penalized for others. this means that RL is done through trial and error, trying actions until it finds the best one. Machine learning is the idea that machines can learn from data that we give them and come up with good outcomes. this encompasses RL because RL is just a method of exploring the data. 
  
What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?

  This means that the algorithm does not need to understand the model of the environment that it is running in for it to fuction. 

What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)

  Q learning is used to find the optimal method of doing something by testing out all the possible outcomes and then keeping track of the best one.
